# How to Use This Application
1) Configure your Identity Provider with the Service Provider information shown above.
2) Click the "Login with SAML" button to initiate SAML authentication.
3) After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to this application.
4) Click the "View Claims" button to see the claims received from the Identity Provider.

# SAML Test Application Certificates Sample

This directory is used to store certificates for SAML authentication. The application expects a certificate file named `samlcert.pfx` in this directory.

## Generating a Self-Signed Certificate for Testing

For testing purposes, you can generate a self-signed certificate using one of the following methods:

### Using PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=SamlTestApp" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature -KeyLength 2048 -KeyAlgorithm RSA -HashAlgorithm SHA256

$pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "password" -Force -AsPlainText

$certPath = "cert:\CurrentUser\My\$($cert.Thumbprint)"
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $certPath -FilePath "samlcert.pfx" -Password $pwd
```

### Using OpenSSL (Cross-Platform)

1. Generate a private key:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out samlcert.key 2048
```

2. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR):
```bash
openssl req -new -key samlcert.key -out samlcert.csr -subj "/CN=SamlTestApp"
```

3. Generate a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in samlcert.csr -signkey samlcert.key -out samlcert.crt
```

4. Create a PFX file:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out samlcert.pfx -inkey samlcert.key -in samlcert.crt -passout pass:password
```

## Certificate Configuration

After generating the certificate, update the `appsettings.json` file with the correct certificate path and password:

```json
"SAML": {
  "CertificatePath": "Certificates/samlcert.pfx",
  "CertificatePassword": "password"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- For production environments, use a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
- Store the certificate password securely, preferably using a secret manager or key vault.
- Ensure that the certificate has the appropriate key usage extensions for SAML signing and encryption.
- Regularly rotate certificates according to your organization's security policies.
